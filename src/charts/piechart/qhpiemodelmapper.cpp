    \brief The QHPieModelMapper is a horizontal model mapper for pie series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A horizontal model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and QPieSeries, so that each column in the data model defines a
    pie slice and each row maps to the label or the value of the pie slice.

    Both model and pie series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model
    mapper keeps the pie series and the data model in sync.

    \brief Horizontal model mapper for pie series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A horizontal model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and PieSeries, so that each column in the data model defines a
    pie slice and each row maps to the label or the value of the pie slice.

    Both model and pie series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model
    mapper keeps the pie series and the data model in sync.

    The following QML example creates a pie series with four slices (assuming the model has
    at least five columns). Each slice gets a label from row 1 and a value from row 2.
    \code
        HPieModelMapper {
            series: pieSeries
            model: customModel
            labelsRow: 1
            valuesRow: 2
            firstColumn: 1
            columnCount: 4
        }
    \endcode
