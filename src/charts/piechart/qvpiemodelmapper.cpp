    \brief The QVPieModelMapper is a vertical model mapper for pie series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A vertical model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and QPieSeries, so that each row in the data model defines a
    pie slice and each column maps to the label or the value of the pie slice.

    Both model and pie series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model
    mapper keeps the pie series and the data model in sync.

    \brief Vertical model mapper for pie series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A vertical model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and PieSeries, so that each row in the data model defines a
    pie slice and each column maps to the label or the value of the pie slice.

    Both model and pie series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model
    mapper keeps the pie series and the data model in sync.

    The following QML example creates a pie series with four slices (assuming the model has at
    least five rows). Each slice gets a label from column 1 and a value from column 2.
    \code
        VPieModelMapper {
            series: pieSeries
            model: customModel
            labelsColumn: 1
            valuesColumn: 2
            firstRow: 1
            rowCount: 4
        }
    \endcode
