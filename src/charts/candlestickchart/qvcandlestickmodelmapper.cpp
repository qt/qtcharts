    \class QVCandlestickModelMapper
    \since 5.8
    \inmodule QtCharts
    \brief The QVCandlestickModelMapper class is a vertical model mapper for a candlestick series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A vertical model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and QCandlestickSeries, so that each column in the data model defines a
    candlestick item and each row maps to the open, high, low, close, and timestamp values
    of the candlestick item.

    Both model and candlestick series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model
    mapper keeps the candlestick series and the data model in sync.

    The model mapper ensures that all the candlestick items in the candlestick series have equal
    sizes. Therefore, adding or removing a value from a candlestick item causes the same change to
    be made in all the candlestick items in the candlestick series.

    \brief Vertical model mapper for a candlestick series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A vertical model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and CandlestickSeries, so that each column in the data model defines a
    candlestick item and each row maps to the open, high, low, close, and timestamp values
    of the candlestick item.

    Both model and candlestick series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model
    mapper keeps the candlestick series and the data model in sync.

    The model mapper ensures that all the candlestick items in the candlestick series have equal
    sizes. Therefore, adding or removing a value from a candlestick item causes the same change to
    be made in all the candlestick items in the candlestick series.

    The following QML example creates a candlestick series with three candlestick items (assuming
    the model has at least four columns). Each candlestick item contains data defined by the
    timestamp, open, high, low, and close rows. The name of an item is defined by the horizontal
    header of the column.
    \qml
        CandlestickSeries {
            VCandlestickModelMapper {
                model: myCustomModel // QAbstractItemModel derived implementation
                timestampRow: 1
                openRow: 2
