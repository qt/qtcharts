    \enum QXYSeries::PointConfiguration

    This enum value describes the particular configuration of a point.

    \value Color
           This enum value can be used to change a point's color. If used together
           with QXYSeries::setPointConfiguration, the configuration's value should
           be a valid QColor.
    \value Size
           This enum value can be used to change a point's size. If used together
           with QXYSeries::setPointConfiguration, the configuration's value should
           be a number, such as \c qreal or \c int.
    \value Visibility
           This enum value can be used to hide or show the point. If used
           together with QXYSeries::setPointConfiguration, the configuration's value
           should be boolean.
    \value LabelVisibility
           This enum value can be used to hide or show the label of the point. If used
           together with QXYSeries::setPointConfiguration, the configuration's value
           should be boolean.
    \value [since 6.5] LabelFormat
           This enum value can be used to set custom label text per-point. If used together with
           QXYSeries::setPointConfiguration, the configuration's value should be a string.
           \note If an empty string is set as the LabelFormat, it will be ignored, and the series

/*!
    \property QXYSeries::pointLabelsFormat
    \brief The format used for showing labels with data points.

    QXYSeries supports the following format tags:
    \table
      \row
        \li @index       \li The index in the series of the data point. [since 6.5]
      \row
        \li @xPoint      \li The x-coordinate of the data point.
      \row
        \li @yPoint      \li The y-coordinate of the data point.
    \endtable

    For example, the following usage of the format tags would produce labels
    that display the data point shown inside brackets separated by a comma
    (x, y):

    \code
    series->setPointLabelsFormat("@index: (@xPoint, @yPoint)");
    \endcode

    By default, the labels' format is set to \c {@xPoint, @yPoint}. The labels
    are shown on the plot area, and the labels on the edge of the plot area are
    cut. If the points are close to each other, the labels may overlap.

/*!
    Enables customizing the appearance of a point located at \a index with
    desired \a configuration.

    With points configuration you can change various aspects of every point's appearance.

    A point's configuration is represented as a hash map with QXYSeries::pointConfiguration
    keys and QVariant values. For example:
    \code
    QLineSeries *series = new QLineSeries();
    series->setName("Customized series");
    series->setPointsVisible(true);

    *series << QPointF(0, 6) << QPointF(2, 4) << QPointF(3, 6) << QPointF(7, 4) << QPointF(10, 5)
            << QPointF(11, 1) << QPointF(13, 3) << QPointF(17, 6) << QPointF(18, 3)
            << QPointF(20, 2);

    QChart *chart = new QChart();
    chart->addSeries(series);
    chart->createDefaultAxes();

    QHash<QXYSeries::PointConfiguration, QVariant> conf;
    conf[QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::Color] = QColor(Qt::red);
    conf[QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::Size] = 8;
    conf[QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::LabelVisibility] = true;

    series->setPointConfiguration(4, conf);

    conf.remove(QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::Color);
    conf[QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::LabelFormat] = "This Point";
    series->setPointConfiguration(6, conf);
    \endcode

    In this example, you can see a default QLineSeries with 10 points and with changed configuration
    of two points. Both changed points are visibly bigger than the others with a look derived from
    the series configuration.
    By default, points don't have labels, but the point at index 4 has a label thanks to the
    QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::LabelVisibility and QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::LabelFormat
    configuration values.
    The point at index 6 has a custom label \e {This Point} thanks to the
    QXYSeries::PointConfiguration::LabelFormat configuration value.
    Below is an example of a chart created in this way:
