    \class QVXYModelMapper
    \inmodule QtCharts
    \brief The QVXYModelMapper class is a vertical model mapper for line,
    spline, and scatter series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel
    class as a data source for a chart. A vertical model mapper is used to
    create a connection between a line, spline, or scatter series and the data
    model that has \e X and \e Y columns for the coordinates and holds the data
    points for the XYSeries as rows. A \e TableModel is a natural choice
    for the model.

    Both model and series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The
    model mapper keeps the series and the data model in sync.
