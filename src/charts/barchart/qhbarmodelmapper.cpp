    \brief The QHBarModelMapper class is a horizontal model mapper for bar series.

    Model mappers enable using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel class
    as a data source for a chart. A horizontal model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and QAbstractBarSeries, so that each row in the data model
    defines a bar set and each column maps to a category in a bar series.

    Both model and bar series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model mapper
    keeps the bar series and the data model in sync.

    The model mapper ensures that all the bar sets in the bar series have equal sizes.
    Therefore, adding or removing a value from a bar set causes the same change to be
    made in all the bar sets in the bar series.

    \brief Horizontal model mapper for bar series.

    The HBarModelMapper type enables using a data model derived from the QAbstractItemModel
    class as a data source for a chart. A horizontal model mapper is used to create a connection
    between a data model and AbstractBarSeries, so that each row in the data model
    defines a bar set and each column maps to a category in a bar series. You need to implement
    the data model and expose it to QML.

    Both model and bar series properties can be used to manipulate the data. The model mapper
    keeps the bar series and the data model in sync.

    The model mapper ensures that all the bar sets in the bar series have equal sizes.
    Therefore, adding or removing a value from a bar set causes the same change to be
    made in all the bar sets in the bar series.

    The following QML code snippet creates a bar series with three bar sets (assuming the model
    has at least four rows). Each bar set contains data starting from column 1. The name
    of a bar set is defined by the row header.
    \code
        BarSeries {
            HBarModelMapper {
                model: myCustomModel // QAbstractItemModel derived implementation
                firstBarSetRow: 1
                lastBarSetRow: 3
                firstColumn: 1
            }
        }
    \endcode
