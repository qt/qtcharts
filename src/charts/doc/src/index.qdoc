    The Qt Charts module provides a set of easy-to-use chart components. It uses
    the Qt Graphics View Framework to integrate charts with modern user
    interfaces. Qt Charts can be used as QWidgets, QGraphicsWidget, or QML
    types. Users can easily create impressive charts by selecting one of the
    themes.

    \section1 Using the Module

    \section2 QML API

    \include {module-use.qdocinc} {using the qml api} {QtCharts}

    \note An instance of QApplication is required for the QML types as the module
    depends on Qt's \l{Graphics View Framework} for rendering. QGuiApplication
    is not sufficient. However, projects created with Qt Creator's
    Qt Quick Application wizard are based on the Qt Quick template that
    uses QGuiApplication by default. All the QGuiApplication instances
    in such projects must be replaced with QApplication.

    \section2 C++ API

    \include {module-use.qdocinc} {using the c++ api}

    \section3 Building with CMake

    \include {module-use.qdocinc} {building with cmake} {Charts}

    \section3 Building with qmake

    \include {module-use.qdocinc} {building_with_qmake} {charts}

    \section1 Module Evolution
    \l{Changes to Qt Charts} lists important changes in the module API
    and functionality that were done for the Qt 6 series of Qt.
