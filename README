---------------
Qt Charts
---------------

Qt Charts module provides a set of easy to use chart components. It uses
the Qt Graphics View Framework, therefore charts can be easily integrated
to modern user interfaces.

System Requirements
===================

- Qt 5.4 or newer
- For QML applications QtQuick 2 is required
- Manipulating Qt Charts graphs with QML Designer requires Qt Creator 3.3 or newer

Building
========
Set up your environment:
example:
    export QTDIR=/opt/Qt5.4.1/5.4/gcc_64/
    export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
    
Configure the project with qmake:
    qmake

After running qmake, build the project with make:
    (Linux) make
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Windows with Visual Studio) nmake
    (OS X) make

The above generates the default makefiles for your configuration, which is typically
the release build if you are using precompiled binary Qt distribution. To build both
debug and release, or one specifically, use one of the following qmake lines instead.

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug
    make
  or
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release
    make debug

For release builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=release
    make
  or
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release
    make release

For both builds (Windows/OS X only):
    qmake CONFIG+="debug_and_release build_all"
    make

After building, install the module to your Qt directory:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the module:
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies, you will just have to add static to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=static

Documentation
=============

The documentation can be generated with:
    make docs

The documentation is generated into the doc folder under the build folder.
Both Qt Assistant (qtcharts.qch) and in HTML format (qtcharts subfolder)
documentation is generated.

Please refer to the generated documentation for more information:
    doc/qtcharts/qtcharts-index.html

Known issues
============

- Zooming too far or too close may eventually freeze the zooming and scrolling.
